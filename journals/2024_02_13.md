	- ## Procedure you should already have implemented:
		- Step 1: Execute the fork system call
			- **What does fork do?**
			  collapsed:: true
				- Fork creates an almost exact copy of the current process, meaning that there is now a second "shell" process running on your computer.
				- The clone process looks nearly identical, meaning it has the same variable values, and is initially on the same line of code (immediately after fork).
			- **How do you interpret the return value of fork?**
			  collapsed:: true
				- The parent (original) and the child (duplicate) process have different return values, which informs the program of whether it is the parent or the child process.
				- ![You know i am right. : r/Invincible](https://i.redd.it/50an0h46mf471.jpg)
		- Step 2: Child process code
			- **What does the child process do?**
			  collapsed:: true
				- The child process should run the execvp system call.
				- **Why do we use execvp instead of execve?**
				  collapsed:: true
					- Execve has an additional parameter for the environment.
					- Execvp uses the PATH environment variable, which contains all of the directories to search for executable files.
					- Environment variables are always copied from the parent process.
				- If execvp failed (if we get to any line of code after execvp), exit with a non-zero exit status so that the child process doesn't create a duplicate shell.
		- Step 3: Parent process code
			- **What does the parent process do?**
				- The parent process should use the waitpid or wait function to wait for the child process to complete.
				- **What is the `int *_Nullable wstatus` argument in wait/waitpid?**
					- This argument is a pointer to an integer.
					- Recall that pointers are just memory addresses (integers), which create the concept of "pass by reference". Dereferencing a pointer follows this procedure.
					  collapsed:: true
						- You have a pointer of type `struct example * pointer_variable_name;`
						- The definition of struct example is as follows:
						  ```c
						  struct example {
						  	char ev1; // Chars take up 1 byte
						      int ev2; // Ints usually take 32 bits (4 bytes)
						  };
						  
						  // Since the example struct contains a char (1 byte) and an
						  // int (4 bytes), the sizeof function will return 4+1=5 bytes 
						  int n = sizeof(struct example);
						  ```
						- Dereferencing, aka, running `*pointer_variable_name`will:
						- Go to the memory address held in the variable.
						- Take the next `n = sizeof(struct example) = 5` bytes at that memory address, where `n` is the size, in bytes, of `struct example`. These bytes become the return value.
					- The macros `WIFEXITED` and `WEXITSTATUS` should be used on the returned integer. See the manpages for wait/waitpid:
					  ```
					  WIFEXITED(wstatus)
					      returns true if the child terminated normally,
					      that is, by calling exit(3) or _exit(2), or by
					      returning from main().
					  
					  WEXITSTATUS(wstatus)
					      returns  the  exit status of the child.  This
					      consists of the least significant 8 bits of the
					      status argument that the child specified in a
					      call to exit(3) or _exit(2) or as the  argument
					      for  a  return statement in main().  This macro
					      should be employed only if WIFEXITED returned
					      true.
					  ```
					  And an example of usage:  
					  ```c
					  // The process did not terminate normally, so we assume
					  // an error and return 1 (recall nonzero return code means error)
					  if (!WIFEXITED(wstatus)) return 1;
					  // The process did terminate normally, so we will take
					  // the return code from the integer
					  return WEXITSTTUS(wstatus);
					  ```
				- Once the child process completed, return the return code of the child status in the function.
	- ## What you need to implement in D2:
		- Functionality we need to add in D2, in order of when you should implement:
			- We must be able to itteratively execute every command in the linked list.
				- **!! IMPORTANT: DO NOT IMPLEMENT THIS RECURSIVELY !!**
				- Hint: The `command` structure is fundamentally a linked list, what can we check in a loop to know if the loop has finished?
			- We need to be able to pipe the output of every non-last command to the next command.
			- We need to finally be able to use files as input and output.
		- Notes on the structure of the `command` struct:
			- Expand this to see code for `struct command`.
			  collapsed:: true
				- ```c
				  struct command {
				  	/* The collected arguments. */
				  	char *argv[ARGS_MAX];
				  
				  	/*
				  	 * The input file, or NULL if none.
				  	 * Note: it is not valid to have an input file on the
				  	 * receiving end of a pipe.
				  	 */
				  	char *input_filename;
				  
				  	/*
				  	 * The output type.
				  	 *
				  	 * COMMAND_OUTPUT_STDOUT:
				  	 *     Output to the terminal.
				  	 * COMMAND_OUTPUT_FILE_TRUNCATE:
				  	 *     Output to the file specified by output_filename.
				  	 *     Overwrite any existing contents.
				  	 * COMMAND_OUTPUT_FILE_APPEND:
				  	 *     Output to the file specified by output_filename.
				  	 *     Append to any existing contents.
				  	 * COMMAND_OUTPUT_PIPE:
				  	 *     Forward the output to the input of the command
				  	 *     specified by pipe_to.
				  	 */
				  	enum command_output_type output_type;
				  	union {
				  		/* When COMMAND_OUTPUT_FILE_*, this is set. */
				  		char *output_filename;
				  		/* When COMMAND_OUTPUT_PIPE, this is set. */
				  		struct command *pipe_to;
				  	};
				  };
				  ```
			- Unions in c mean that the contained variables share the same memory.
			  collapsed:: true
				- This is how variants in OCAML/enums in Rust/the sum algebraic data type is implemented: [tagged unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union).
				- If `cmd->output_filename == 0x05`, then `cmd->pipe_to == 0x05`, despite the types being different.
				- This is done this way, as there is either an output file or another command, there can not be both!
				- *This means you can not check if there is another element in the linked list simply by checking `if (cmd->pipe_to == NULL)`, as if there if an output filename, it will treat the pointer to the output filename as a poiter to a `struct command`, causing a segmentation fault.*
					- Use `cmd->output_type` instead!
		- **What is output by the open function, created by the pipe function, and represented in `STDIN_FILENO` and `STDOUT_FILENO`?**
			- Integers, which are used as file descriptors!
			- Every process image has a file descriptor table, which is accessed like any other array/table (via indices), and stores information about the open files. File descriptors are the indices to this table, and are used in the functions that modify the tabe
			- Example fd table:
			  | Index | Description of file |
			  | 0 == STDIN_FILENO | standard input (reading from TTY) |
			  | 1 == STDOUT_FILENO | standard output (writing to TTY) |
			  | 2 == STDERR_FILENO | standard error (writing to TTY) |
			  | 3... | files you opened |
			- Implicitly, every process interprets whichever file is in index 0 (`STDIN_FILENO == 0`) as stdin, in index 1 (`STDOUT_FILENO == 1`)  as stdout, and in index 2 (`STDERR_FILENO == 2`) as stderr. By default, these indices point to a buffer in memory which is read by your TTY (terminal).
			- If we execute `printf("Hello world!";`, the process will write to whichever file is in index `STDOUT_FILENO`, so if we switch the file at that index, it will write to that file instead of your TTY.
		- **How does dup2 work?**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Lets digest the manpage for dup/dup2.
			  ```
			  SYNOPSIS
			         #include <unistd.h>
			  
			         int dup(int oldfd);
			         int dup2(int oldfd, int newfd);
			  
			         #define _GNU_SOURCE             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
			         #include <fcntl.h>              /* Definition of O_* constants */
			         #include <unistd.h>
			  
			         int dup3(int oldfd, int newfd, int flags);
			  ```
			  So, it appears that dup2 takes in two file integers, which are named oldfd and newfd in the function. This means that these are probably file descriptors/indices on the table.
			  ```
			  DESCRIPTION
			         The dup() system call allocates a new file descriptor that
			         refers to the same open file description as the descriptor
			         oldfd.  (For an explanation of open file descriptions, see
			         open(2).)  The new file descriptor number is guaranteed to
			         be  the lowest‐numbered file descriptor that was unused in
			         the calling process.
			  ```
			  It looks like dup is not what we are looking for (it is not), but it is still useful to understand for the context of dup2. Let's fast forward a bit to dup2.
			  ```
			  dup2()
			         The dup2() system call performs the same  task  as  dup(),
			         but  instead  of using the lowest‐numbered unused file de‐
			         scriptor, it uses the file descriptor number specified  in
			         newfd.   In  other words, the file descriptor newfd is ad‐
			         justed so that it now refers to the  same  open  file  de‐
			         scription as oldfd.
			  
			         If  the  file  descriptor newfd was previously open, it is
			         closed  before  being  reused;  the  close  is   performed
			         silently  (i.e.,  any  errors during the close are not re‐
			         ported by dup2()).
			  
			         ...
			  
			           Note the following points:
			  
			         •  If  oldfd is not a valid file descriptor, then the call
			            fails, and newfd is not closed.
			  
			         •  If oldfd is a valid file descriptor, and newfd has  the
			            same  value as oldfd, then dup2() does nothing, and re‐
			            turns newfd.
			  ```
			  So it appears that dup2 will take a file descriptor (lets say 4), and copy the contents at index 4 of the file table to the second index provided.
			- Lets say we wanted to open a file and move it to `STDOUT_FILENO` so that when we try to write to stdout, we write to that file. Here is some example code:
			  ```c
			  // Opens a file with permisions to write, create the file if it doesn't
			  // exist, and truncate (as opposed to append).
			  int newfd = open("filename.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC);
			  
			  // Copies the contents and index newfd to index STDOUT_FILENO
			  dup2(newfd, STDOUT_FILENO);
			  ```
				- **What does the syntax of `O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC`** mean?
					- The `|` operator is the bitwise or, as opposed to the `||` operator which is the logical or.
					- The logical or is implemented using the bitwise or, except it is abstracted for using booleans instead of integer data.
					- The bitwise or runs an or operation on every bit of the two operands. The examples under this node use binary notation (binary data is prefixed with `0b`, as opposed to hexadecimal which is prefixed with `0x`).
						- `.0b00 | 0b00 == 0b00`
						- `0b00 | 0b01 == 0b01`
						- `0b10 | 0b00 == 0b10`
						- `0b10 | 0b01 = 0b11`
					- Each flag (`O_WRONLY`, `O_CREAT`, ...) can be though of as a single enabled bit. When or'ed together, the bits that are on indicate the privileges that are requested.
		- **How does pipe work?**
			- Lets refer to the manpage for pipe.
			  ```
			  SYNOPSIS
			         #include <unistd.h>
			  
			         int pipe(int pipefd[2]);
			  
			         #define _GNU_SOURCE             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
			         #include <fcntl.h>              /* Definition of O_* constants */
			         #include <unistd.h>
			  
			         int pipe2(int pipefd[2], int flags);
			  
			         /* On Alpha, IA‐64, MIPS, SuperH, and SPARC/SPARC64, pipe() has the
			            following prototype; see VERSIONS */
			  
			         #include <unistd.h>
			  
			         struct fd_pair {
			             long fd[2];
			         };
			         struct fd_pair pipe(void);
			  ```
			  Pipe takes in an array of two integers, which appear to both be fds.
			  ```
			  DESCRIPTION
			         pipe() creates a pipe, a unidirectional data channel that can be used for interprocess communication.  The array pipefd is used to re‐
			         turn  two  file descriptors referring to the ends of the pipe.  pipefd[0] refers to the read end of the pipe.  pipefd[1] refers to the
			         write end of the pipe.  Data written to the write end of the pipe is buffered by the kernel until it is read from the read end of  the
			         pipe.  For further details, see pipe(7).
