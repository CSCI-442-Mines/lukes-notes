# Project 2 Deliverable 2 Recitation
	- ## Procedure you should already have implemented:
		- Step 1: Execute the fork system call
			- **What does fork do?**
			  collapsed:: true
				- Fork creates an almost exact copy of the current process, meaning that there is now a second "shell" process running on your computer.
				- The clone process looks nearly identical, meaning it has the same variable values, and is initially on the same line of code (immediately after fork).
			- **How do you interpret the return value of fork?**
			  collapsed:: true
				- The parent (original) and the child (duplicate) process have different return values, which informs the program of whether it is the parent or the child process.
				- ![You know i am right. : r/Invincible](https://i.redd.it/50an0h46mf471.jpg)
		- Step 2: Child process code
			- **What does the child process do?**
			  collapsed:: true
				- The child process should run the execvp system call.
				- **Why do we use execvp instead of execve?**
				  collapsed:: true
					- Execve has an additional parameter for the environment.
					- Execvp uses the PATH environment variable, which contains all of the directories to search for executable files.
					- Environment variables are always copied from the parent process.
				- If execvp failed (if we get to any line of code after execvp), exit with a non-zero exit status so that the child process doesn't create a duplicate shell.
		- Step 3: Parent process code
			- **What does the parent process do?**
			  collapsed:: true
				- The parent process should use the waitpid or wait function to wait for the child process to complete.
				- **What is the `int *_Nullable wstatus` argument in wait/waitpid?**
				  collapsed:: true
					- This argument is a pointer to an integer.
					- Recall that pointers are just memory addresses (integers), which create the concept of "pass by reference". Dereferencing a pointer follows this procedure.
					  collapsed:: true
						- You have a pointer of type `struct example * pointer_variable_name;`
						- The definition of struct example is as follows:
						  ```c
						  struct example {
						  	char ev1; // Chars take up 1 byte
						      int ev2; // Ints usually take 32 bits (4 bytes)
						  };
						  
						  // Since the example struct contains a char (1 byte) and an
						  // int (4 bytes), the sizeof function will return 4+1=5 bytes 
						  int n = sizeof(struct example);
						  ```
						- Dereferencing, aka, running `*pointer_variable_name`will:
						- Go to the memory address held in the variable.
						- Take the next `n = sizeof(struct example) = 5` bytes at that memory address, where `n` is the size, in bytes, of `struct example`. These bytes become the return value.
					- The macros `WIFEXITED` and `WEXITSTATUS` should be used on the returned integer. See the manpages for wait/waitpid:
					  ```
					  WIFEXITED(wstatus)
					      returns true if the child terminated normally,
					      that is, by calling exit(3) or _exit(2), or by
					      returning from main().
					  
					  WEXITSTATUS(wstatus)
					      returns  the  exit status of the child.  This
					      consists of the least significant 8 bits of the
					      status argument that the child specified in a
					      call to exit(3) or _exit(2) or as the  argument
					      for  a  return statement in main().  This macro
					      should be employed only if WIFEXITED returned
					      true.
					  
					  ```
					  And an example of usage:  
					  ```c
					  // The process did not terminate normally, so we assume
					  // an error and return 1 (recall nonzero return code means error)
					  if (!WIFEXITED(wstatus)) return 1;
					  // The process did terminate normally, so we will take
					  // the return code from the integer
					  return WEXITSTTUS(wstatus);
					  ```
				- Once the child process completed, return the return code of the child status in the function.
	- ## What you need to implement in D2:
		- Functionality we need to add in D2, in order of when you should implement:
			- We must be able to itteratively execute every command in the linked list.
				- **!! IMPORTANT: DO NOT IMPLEMENT THIS RECURSIVELY !!**
			- We need to be able to pipe the output of every non-last command to the next command.
			- We need to finally be able to use files as input and output.
		- Notes on the structure of the `command` struct:
			- Expand this to see code
			  collapsed:: true
				- ```c
				  struct command {
				  	/* The collected arguments. */
				  	char *argv[ARGS_MAX];
				  
				  	/*
				  	 * The input file, or NULL if none.
				  	 * Note: it is not valid to have an input file on the
				  	 * receiving end of a pipe.
				  	 */
				  	char *input_filename;
				  
				  	/*
				  	 * The output type.
				  	 *
				  	 * COMMAND_OUTPUT_STDOUT:
				  	 *     Output to the terminal.
				  	 * COMMAND_OUTPUT_FILE_TRUNCATE:
				  	 *     Output to the file specified by output_filename.
				  	 *     Overwrite any existing contents.
				  	 * COMMAND_OUTPUT_FILE_APPEND:
				  	 *     Output to the file specified by output_filename.
				  	 *     Append to any existing contents.
				  	 * COMMAND_OUTPUT_PIPE:
				  	 *     Forward the output to the input of the command
				  	 *     specified by pipe_to.
				  	 */
				  	enum command_output_type output_type;
				  	union {
				  		/* When COMMAND_OUTPUT_FILE_*, this is set. */
				  		char *output_filename;
				  		/* When COMMAND_OUTPUT_PIPE, this is set. */
				  		struct command *pipe_to;
				  	};
				  };
				  ```
